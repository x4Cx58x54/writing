[Tutorial | Vim Tips Wiki](https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Tutorial)

* `a` **append** after current location
* `A` **append** after cuttent line

* `cw`/`ce` **change word** (delete to the end of current word and start insert mode)
* `cc` **change** line (same as `S`)
* `C` delete to the end of line and start insert mode

### Copy and Paste

* `y{move}` **yank**
* `yy`/`Y` yank current line, including the ending newline
* `y$` yank to the end of current line, excluding newline

### Search and Replace

[Search and replace | Vim Tips Wiki](https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Search_and_replace)

* `/regex` search for regex
* `?regex` search backwards

`:s`/`:substutute` command searches for regex and replace with text.

* `:s/foo/bar/g` substitute all 'foo' in current line (**global**) with 'bar'
* `:%s/foo/bar/g` substitute 'foo' in all lines with 'bar'
* `:%s/foo/bar/gc` substitute each 'foo' with 'bar', but ask for **confirmation** first
* `:%s/\<foo\>/bar/g` substitute only whole words exactly matching 'foo' with 'bar'
* `:%s/foo/bar/gi` case-**insensitive**
* `:%s/foo\c/bar/g` **case**-insensitive
* `:%s/foo/bar/gI` case-sensitive
* `:%s/foo\C/bar/g` case-sensitive

`:set ignorecase`/`:set ic` and `:set noignorecase`/`:set noic` (default) makes searchings case-insensitive/sensitive by default.

`\zs` and `\ze` delimits the pattern to replace. For example, `:s/Copyright \zs2019\ze/2020` substitutes 2019 with 2020.

When replacing:

* `\r` is newline
* `\n` is null byte (0x00)
* `\0` is the text matched by the entire pattern
* `\1` is the text of the first backreference

* `aw` **a word**
* `as` **a sentence**
* `ap` **a paragraph**
* `ab` **a block**

and `j`, `w`...

* `nj` move n lines down
* `dnw` delete n words including trailing space
* `dne` delete n words leaving trailing space (till the end of word)
* `dnl` delete n characters right
* `dnk` delete n lines up (delete n+1 lines)
* `dnb` delete n words backwards

## File Operations

* `:res(ize) n` set current window height to n
* `ctrl-w </>` change current window width by 1
* `ctrl-w n</n>`/`:vertical res(ize) +n/-n` change current window width by n
* `:vertical res(ize) n` set current window width to n
* `ctrl-w =` resize all windows equally based on splits
* `ctrl-w _` increase to max height
